About Project 

Part 1

 Cyber Security Basic Network Sniffer.pdf

Python script using Scapy serves as a foundational tool for exploring network traffic analysis, offering hands-on insight into packet structures, protocols like IP, TCP, and UDP, and the flow of data across networks. By capturing and dissecting packets, users gain a deeper appreciation for how information travels, potential vulnerabilities in transmission, and the importance of monitoring for security threats. Remember, such tools should always be used ethically and legally, with proper permissions, to enhance cybersecurity knowledge rather than exploit systems. This example underscores the value of practical scripting in building robust network defense strategies, encouraging further experimentation in controlled environments to strengthen skills in protocol analysis and threat detection.

Part 2

Cyber Security Phishing Awareness Training 

To wrap up this phishing awareness module, it's clear that phishing remains one of the most prevalent and deceptive cyber threats, relying on social engineering to exploit human trust rather than technical flaws. By recognizing key indicators in emails, websites, and tactics like pretexting or authority impersonation, and adopting best practices such as verifying sources, enabling 2FA, and reporting suspicions, individuals and organizations can significantly reduce risks. Real-world examples, from massive corporate breaches like Colonial Pipeline to everyday scams, highlight the costly consequences of complacency. Ultimately, ongoing education, vigilance, and a skeptical mindset form the strongest shield against these attacks—stay informed, practice regularly, and consult security experts to safeguard your digital world.
