About Project 

Part 1

 Cyber Security Basic Network Sniffer.pdf

Python script using Scapy serves as a foundational tool for exploring network traffic analysis, offering hands-on insight into packet structures, protocols like IP, TCP, and UDP, and the flow of data across networks. By capturing and dissecting packets, users gain a deeper appreciation for how information travels, potential vulnerabilities in transmission, and the importance of monitoring for security threats. Remember, such tools should always be used ethically and legally, with proper permissions, to enhance cybersecurity knowledge rather than exploit systems. This example underscores the value of practical scripting in building robust network defense strategies, encouraging further experimentation in controlled environments to strengthen skills in protocol analysis and threat detection.
